97,Cross Site Request Forgery,Elevation Of Privilege,Azure Web App,HTTPS GET/POST TLS 1.2+,High,Not Started,,"Cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) is a type of attack in which an attacker forces a user's browser to make a forged request to a vulnerable site by exploiting an existing trust relationship between the browser and the vulnerable web site.  In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting. The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL/TLS.

147,Cross Site Request Forgery,Elevation Of Privilege,Azure Web App,Deploy package (HTTPS – Zip Deploy/ARM),High,Not Started,,"Cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) is a type of attack in which an attacker forces a user's browser to make a forged request to a vulnerable site by exploiting an existing trust relationship between the browser and the vulnerable web site.  In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting. The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL/TLS. See the Forgery Protection property on the flow stencil for a list of mitigations.",,Generated
